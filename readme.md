Guessing Game Assignment for Code Fellows (Code 201)

Darnell Holder

This is a simple guessing game that prompts the user to guess the answers to questions about me and alerts them as to whether there answers were correct or incorrect. If a user gets enough correct answers they will be sent to a bonus guessing game that asks them to guess a number between 0-15 it will let them know whether their answer was too high, too low or correct. It will keep running until the user inputs the correct number.
